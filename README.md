## Ebarat

Ebarat is a tool designed to help users translate words from English to Arabic and then find words or phrases in Arabic that are similar or related to the searched term.

Ebarat can be used to find similar or related words both in Standard/Classical Arabic (al-ʻArabīyah al-Fuṣḥā العربية الفصحى) as well as colloquial Arabic in a variety of different dialects. Although the "Translation" will usually be in standard Arabic, the "related words" are likely to vary.

This webapp runs using AraVec, a pre-trained distributed word representation (word embedding) open source project, along with the Google Translate API.
